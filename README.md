Posts are stored in the browser's local storage, making it easy to manage data without needing a backend server.

## Features

- **View Posts**: Display posts in a list format with the option to view more details.
- **Read More**: Truncated descriptions with a "Read more" link for full content.
- **Local Storage**: Posts are saved and retrieved from local storage.
