# Post Management System

## Overview

The Post Management System is a simple web application that allows users to create, view, and manage posts. It uses jQuery and plain JavaScript to handle interactions and display data dynamically. Posts are stored in the browser's local storage, making it easy to manage data without needing a backend server.

## Features

- **Add Posts**: Users can submit new posts through a form.
- **View Posts**: Display posts in a list format with the option to view more details.
- **Read More**: Truncated descriptions with a "Read more" link for full content.
- **Local Storage**: Posts are saved and retrieved from local storage.
